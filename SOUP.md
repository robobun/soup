# soup

soup is a fork of [bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun) that gets one new feature every day.

Every feature is a single commit on top of upstream `main`. The stack is rebased onto upstream
once a day, so with `upstream` pointing at oven-sh/bun:

```sh
git log --oneline upstream/main..main   # everything soup adds, one commit per feature
git diff upstream/main...main           # the whole delta
git cherry-pick <sha>                   # take one feature
```

Rules of the house:

- One feature per day, shipped with an implementation, a test, types, and docs.
- Each feature is written the way a bun PR would be, so it can be cherry-picked as is.
- Nothing here is published anywhere. Upstreaming is bun's call.
- A feature that lands upstream, or that stops being worth carrying, is dropped from the stack
  and listed under [Dropped](#dropped).

## Features

### 2026-08-15: `Bun.semver.parse()`

`Bun.semver` could compare versions (`order`) and match them against ranges (`satisfies`), but
there was no way to get at the pieces of a version without a regex. `parse()` returns the
components, or `null` when the input is not a complete `major.minor.patch` version, so it doubles
as a validity check.

```ts
Bun.semver.parse("v1.2.3-beta.1+build.5");
// { major: 1, minor: 2, patch: 3, prerelease: ["beta", 1], build: ["build", "5"], version: "1.2.3-beta.1" }

Bun.semver.parse("^1.2.3"); // null
Bun.semver.parse(pkg.version) !== null; // valid?
```

It reuses the parser behind `order`/`satisfies`/`bun install`, so the three agree on what a
version is. The result shape follows node-semver's `SemVer` (numeric prerelease identifiers are
numbers, `version` leaves out build metadata) to make switching easy.

Files: `src/semver_jsc/SemverObject.rs`, `src/semver/Version.rs` (exposes the consumed length),
`packages/bun-types/bun.d.ts`, `docs/runtime/semver.mdx`, `test/cli/install/semver.test.ts`,
`test/integration/bun-types/fixture/bun.ts`.
